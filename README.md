# Dashboard
Dashboard application to monitor server status using ReactJs

## Info
Just some dummy app playing with [Material Design Lite](https://www.getmdl.io), I'll most likely implement for my home server some utility from this.

### TODO
##### Server
[ ] Implement Node Server
[ ] Api, most likely cpu, ram, network, uptime, cpu temp
[ ] Have different types of servers? Different charts maybe...
[ ] Login ?

##### Client
[x] Main page
[x] Monitor list
[x] Detail dialog
[ ] Allow adding a new server monitor on client
[ ] Login ?
