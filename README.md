# Dashboard
Dashboard application to monitor server status using ReactJs

## Info
Just some dummy app playing with [Material Design Lite](https://www.getmdl.io), I'll most likely implement for my home server some utility from this.

### TODO
##### Server
- [ ] Implement Node Server
- [ ] Api, most likely cpu, ram, network, uptime, cpu temp
- [ ] Have different types of servers? Different charts maybe...
- [ ] Login ?

##### Client
- [x] Main page
- [x] Monitor list
- [x] Detail dialog
- [ ] Allow adding a new server monitor on client
- [ ] Login ?
